# Horse-Fields-Creator
An Angular web app built to create .evt data compatible with Finish Lynx photo finish software

Because Judges in Queensland don't have access to the Racing SNS system, fields need to be manually hand typed using the correct spacing and syntax. The purpose of this web app is to make writing out the fields easier and prevent syntax issues by entering data through forms that validate the data. After entering all the data, the fields can then be exported in the correct format ready to be inserted in the Finish Lynx event file.

Example of correct format:
